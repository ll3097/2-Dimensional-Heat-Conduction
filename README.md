# 2-Dimensional-heat-conduction

**Instruction:**

1.Firstly, please open the folder:'final project coarse mesh'. Then please run the file: 'heat2d.m' and you will get first two figures of temperature distribution and flux for coarse mesh.
Next,you can run the file:'input_file_465ele.m' to see the coarse mesh generation(Please remember to run file:'heat2d.m' before you run 'input_file_465ele.m'. )

2.Sencondly, please open the folder:'final project refined mesh'. Then please run the file: 'heat2d.m' and you will get second two figures of temperature distribution and flux for refined mesh.
Next,you can run the file:'input_file_1894ele.m' to see the refined mesh generation (Please remember to run file:'heat2d.m' before you run 'input_file_1894ele.m'. )

3.Next, you can open the folder:'Temp figures along edges' and you can check our codes for plotting temperature variation figures on edges.

4.Next, you can open the folder:'Flux figures along edges' and you can check our codes for plotting flux figures on egdes .

5.Next, you can open the folder:'Average Band Width' and you can check our codes for calculationg average band width.

6,Next, you can open the folder:'Temperature comparison between Abaqus and Matlab' and folder:'Flux comparison between Abaqus and Matlab' to see the comparison of results in MATLAB and ABAQUS.

7.Finally,you can check our report.

NOTE:If there are some differences between the report of hard-copy version and the PDF version uploaded on website, please view the PDF version as the correct one.Thanks!
